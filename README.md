## Overview
This repository contains the Unity package for the StateMachine system based on a Hierarchical State Machine (HSM).

### What is a Hierarchical State Machine (HSM)?
A Hierarchical State Machine (HSM) is a state management architecture where states can have sub-states. Each sub-state can inherit behaviors and transitions from its parent state, enabling the modeling of complex behavior with reduced redundancy.

## Installation
1. Open the Unity Package Manager.
2. Enter the Git URL of this repository to import the package.

## Usage
- Import the package into a Unity project.
- Use the `StateMachineManager`, `State`, and `Transition` classes to implement state management.
